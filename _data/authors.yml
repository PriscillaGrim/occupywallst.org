  bio: |
    Justine is the co-founder of OSN, a Software Engineer at Google, and a
    self-described "Champagne Tranarchist".

    She wants to see a world revolution, starting with a popular uprising
    against the financial executives who plunder society without contributing
    any social utility. She hopes that her work will result in a friendlier and
    more compassionate society.

    She has been profiled in [The Nation](breaking-up-with-occupy) by Nathan
    Schneider, [The New Yorker](pre-occupied) by Mattathias Schwartz,
    [BetaBeat](betabeat-militia) by Jessica Roy, and in [Written Off
    America](occupy-eats-own) by Jerry Ashton.

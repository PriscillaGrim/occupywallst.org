    Justine Tunney is the co-founder of OSN, a Software Engineer at Google, and
    a self-described "Champagne Tranarchist".

    She wants to see a world revolution, starting with a popular uprising
    against the financial executives who plunder society without contributing
    any social utility. She hopes that her work will result in a friendlier and
    more compassionate society.

    She has been profiled in [The Nation][breaking-up-with-occupy] by Nathan
    Schneider, [The New Yorker][pre-occupied] by Mattathias Schwartz,
    [BetaBeat][betabeat-militia] by Jessica Roy, and in [Written Off
    America][occupy-eats-own] by Jerry Ashton.

title: Can we protest the animal holocaust on S17 instead of TPP?
---

It has recently come to my attention that 50 billion land animals (and probably
another 90 billion sea animals) are murdered by humans each year for food
([source][kill-count]). How could I not have noticed this sooner? To think that
all these years I’ve been fighting to “get money out of politics” and “bring
back the middle class” while the most prolific outbreak of mass murder in human
history has been happening right beneath my nose! I feel ashamed.


I hate to say it, but **we’re going to have to put fighting Wall Street on the
back-burner** for a little while. At least until we’ve made some progress in
stopping the animal genocide.

I started a centi-thread on OccupyWallSt.org about this issue three weeks ago,
so this topic is already being debated within the movement:
<http://occupywallst.org/forum/the-goal-of-occupy-should-be-to-end-violence-again/>
*(BTW I love how the forum I coded from scratch while living in a park is still
a thriving community to this day. You guys should really hang out there more
often.)*

In times like these, I feel it’s a strategic error to focus our efforts on the
issues of abstract economic reform like stopping TPP or reinstating
Glass-Steagall. No one understands that shit. And even if we were 100%
effective in executing our agenda and our opinions on the issue turned out to
be correct and didn’t do more harm than good, the best case scenario is that
we’ll help a few million or so going through tough times financially over the
coming decades. Helping millions may seem noble, but I’d call it’s petty
compared to the trillions being murdered and ignored. **The animal genocide is
the most important issue of our time.** History has granted us an opportunity
to stand up and fight for what’s right. We must decide if we want to be looked
back upon favorably by our grandchildren, or become their source of shame. So
today, I’ve officially thrown down the wedge: Which side are you on, boys?

If we accept the discoveries of science that human beings are animals like any
other, and we freely choose to accept the opinion that life has value,
happiness should be attainable, suffering should not be inflicted unless
necessary, and justice comes from ensuring these concepts apply to the greatest
number possible—then one must conclude that no issue is more important than
ending the animal holocaust. **In 2003 alone, casualties were 3.4 orders of a
magnitude higher than all the deaths in WWII put together.**
(`3.4≈log(150e9/60e6)`, [source][ww2-deaths]) I apologize for using engineering
notation, but the scale of these atrocities creates numbers so large that they
simply can’t be expressed any other way. The fact is that if we don’t act now,
the derivative of dead bodies will only continue to rise over time as the
third-world modernizes and their emerging middle classes begin demanding the
western luxuries we take for granted that are predicated on suffering. The
capitalists will continue building factory farms to meet demand because they
have no conscience. They’ll keep growing and killing until eventually the whole
planet becomes a slaughterhouse and then they too shall meet their demise. *Red
ink flows like a river of blood.*

Perhaps Occupy’s tragic flaw has always been our own selfishness. Always caring
about the middle class, sitting around in a park eating animal flesh fresh from
the local pizzeria. The only thing we wondered about was who paid for the
pizza; no one asked who died for it.

I bring you these revelations at great personal risk to mine activist
career. The topic of animal liberation is so taboo that I’m breaking the
unspoken rules of social propriety by even bringing it up! I expect some of you
will label me divisive or a troll. But in doing so you’ve only affirmed mine
ability to rouse your cognitive dissonance. The only thing you have to lose is
your ignorance, so expect no pity from me.

But what what infuriates me the most is when people try to defend the meat
industry. If you write a reply disagreeing with me, I’d be appreciative if you
could explain which of the stated premises you disagree with, or at least own
up to the fact that you’ve sacrificed consistency for the sake of lifestyle
because you haven’t got the heart for care for these poor animals. Just please,
don’t try to rationalize what you’re doing. We both know it’s wrong.

To give you an example of this behavior, I saw an
[anarchist documentary][hold-fast] once where they filmed this poor little
fishy—who never hurt anyone and just wanted to swim and be happy—being plucked
from its home in the sea only to be beaten to death with a wooden club. An
entire lifetime gone, just so some humans could experience a fleeting moment of
“tasty” sustenance. Moxie chose to leave this scene unedited, forcing us to
watch the murder in its full lengthy glory. But what saddens me the most is
that as I sat there cringing, I looked upon the transfixed faces of my friends
who unlike me were not perturbed by such brutish behavior. The eyes glazed over
as the countenance bore a chilling sense of serenity, like the uncaring
psychopath who hungers for a meal. But these are just normal people who support
progressive causes and care deeply about social/economic justice. But somehow
they have this magical ability to flip a switch that makes them not care about
animals.

As for the nature argument: I say that everything we do is natural, which means
nothing is natural. If it could be said that we as humans have any nature at
all, it would be the ability to choose. This means:

1. We can *choose* to get our calories from a source that doesn’t require suffering.
2. We can *choose* to shut down the factory farms, using force if necessary.
3. We can *choose* to build a new culture that doesn’t require an unterlumpenproletariat class whose sole possession of significant material value is their ability to die.
4. We can *choose* to engineer clever harm-free substitutes like [synthetic beef][frankenmeat].

With choice comes responsibility. Now I know you’re all very responsible people, so I have no doubt you’ll all choose wisely.

# About

Occupy Wall Street is a people-powered movement that began on September 17,
2011 in Liberty Square in Manhattan’s Financial District, and has spread to
over 100 cities in the United States and actions in over 1,500 cities
globally. #ows is fighting back against the corrosive power of major banks and
multinational corporations over the democratic process, and the role of Wall
Street in creating an economic collapse that has caused the greatest recession
in generations. The movement is inspired by popular uprisings in Egypt and
Tunisia, and aims to fight back against the richest 1% of people that are
writing the rules of an unfair global economy that is foreclosing on our
future.

OccupyWallSt.org is the oldest and most trusted online resource for the Occupy
Movement. We were founded on July 14th, 2011 when Justine Tunney organized a
scrappy group of anarchists to take the initiative in organizing a
[call to action published by Micah White in Adbusters magazine](call-to-action).

## Some Leaders of a Leaderless (and Leader-full) Movement

OccupyWallSt.org is operated by The Occupy Solidarity Network, Inc. (OSN) a New
York 501(c)(4) not-for-profit organization.

The following three people make up our board of directors:

### Micah M. White, PhD

Micah White is the American creator of the Occupy Wall Street meme. He has been
profiled by [The New Yorker](pre-occupied), The Walrus and the alumni magazine
of Swarthmore College for his founding role in the movement. After eight years
at Adbusters—where he rose from campaigns intern to guest editor, editor and
ultimately editor-at-large—White is now the founder of
[Boutique Activist Consultancy](boutique) and a board member of the Occupy
Solidarity Network, OccupyWallSt.org.

Priscilla Grim works as a Content Cleric for Occupy, and is a Brooklyn mother,
who has been miscredited with "secretly running the Occupy Movement out of her
Brooklyn apartment this whole time" by [Dan Rather](dan-rather-article). She
co-founded the Shorty Award winning [We Are The 99 Percent](wearethe99percent)
Tumblr blog and served as a co-founding editor (by being one of a handful of
people who showed up at Bean & Bean) on the
*[Occupied Wall Street Journal](owsj)*

Priscilla co-founded the Occupied Solidarity Network along with Justine to form
a fund to support the work of occupy activists. To pay the bills, Priscilla is
a proud team member at an educational website where she helps children learn
through free online games. Before Occupy Wall Street, she helped in the
founding of [Real Punk Radio](http://realpunkradio.com), and tried to fight
[media concentration](media-concentration). She wants to help build a
transformed world in which people have all they need to live, so that they can
make amazing things, raise their families, and build a better global society.

Justine is the co-founder of OSN, a Software Engineer at Google, and a
self-described "Champagne Tranarchist".

She wants to see a world revolution, starting with a popular uprising against
the financial executives who plunder society without contributing any social
utility. She hopes that her work will result in a friendlier and more
compassionate society.

She has been profiled in [The Nation](breaking-up-with-occupy) by Nathan
Schneider, [The New Yorker](pre-occupied) by Mattathias Schwartz,
